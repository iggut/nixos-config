# üóíÔ∏è About

Strap on your NixOS install USB, ISO, or any storage device of your fancy, grab a cold beer, and brace yourself for a wild ride of error fixing! It's like a rollercoaster for tech enthusiasts, where the screams of frustration are drowned out by the clinking of beer bottles. But fear not, for with each error conquered, you'll emerge stronger, wiser, and perhaps a little tipsy. So, hop on this exhilarating journey, where code meets hops, and let's show those errors who's boss! Cheers to debugging adventures!
Boot the USB/ISO

1. **Clone + Username:**
   `git clone https://github.com/iggut/nixos-config.git`
   Change all occurances of `iggut` to your desired username.

2. **Partitioning**

   Disko now take care of this. Lucky you! Just make sure your drive is nvme0n1 since that is what will get destroyed by the install script. The disks (in hosts) file can be modified for the drive of your choosing.

3. **Sip**

   ```bash
   $sip your beer
   ```

4. **Install nixos from flake**
   Change all occurances of `iggut` to your desired username.
   ```bash
   $ bash install-with-disko HOSTNAME
   ```
   Change `HOSTNAME` to your desired hostname.
   ```bash
   $ sip your beer
   ```
